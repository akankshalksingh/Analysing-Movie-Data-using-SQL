# Analysing-Movie-Data-using-SQL

### Case Study

The insurance policy of Maven Movies is due for renewal, and the underwriters of the insurance company require updated information from the company before they can issue a new policy.

### Description

MavenMovies SQL Queries is a collection of SQL queries designed to retrieve important data from the MavenMovies database. The queries provide valuable insights into the inventory, customer base, staff, and financial aspects of the business. This project is a useful tool for business owners and managers who want to better understand their company's operations. Simply copy and paste the queries into your preferred SQL editor and execute them to view the results. You can also contribute to this project by adding your own SQL queries that may be useful for analyzing the MavenMovies database or a similar business.

### Objective 

This project is to gather and provide updated information to the underwriters of the insurance company regarding the operations and risks associated with the Maven Movies business. The updated information will enable the insurance company to assess the risks and determine the appropriate insurance coverage and premiums for the renewed insurance policy.

### The project workflow aims to answer the following key questions required by the insurance underwriters:

1. Obtain a comprehensive list of all staff members, including their first and last names, email addresses, and the store identification number where they work.
2. Conduct separate counts of inventory items held at each of the two stores.
3. Provide a count of active customers for each of the stores, separately.
4. Determine the count of all customer email addresses stored in the database, to assess the liability of a potential data breach.
5. Analyze the diversity of the film offerings to understand the likelihood of keeping customers engaged. Provide a count of unique film titles and categories available at each store.
6. Determine the replacement cost of films by providing the replacement cost for the least expensive, most expensive, and the average of all films carried.
7. Implement payment monitoring systems and maximum payment processing restrictions to minimize the future risk of fraud by staff. Provide the average and maximum payment processed.
8. Obtain a better understanding of the customer base by providing a list of all customer identification values with a count of rentals they have made all-time, with the highest volume customers listed at the top.
